# ## The revised instructions as per Tanya indicated that the current instructions are no longer working. APIs are notorious for changing out from under us. The provided link no longer returns lyrics.

# ## Question #1 Set-up environment and poem text to be analize

#To see which poems that author has available, go to 
# https://poetrydb.org/author/AUTHOR NAME
# e.g.: https://poetrydb.org/author/Edgar Allan Poe
#The spaces will get handled by your web browser

# ## Question 2 second part:  Setting up sentiment analysis with SpacyTextBlob

docx._.polarity


# ## Answer to question# 2:  Given that the range of the polarity score is [-1.0,1.0] which corresponds to how positive or negative the text in question is, do you think the lyrics have a more positive or negative connotaion
# 
# ## Answer:  is positive connotation with polarity value of positive 0.0556.

# ## Question 3:  Write a function that takes an artist, song, and filename, accesses the lyrics.ovh api to get the song lyrics, and writes the results to the specified filename. Test this function by getting the lyrics to any four songs of your choice and storing them in different files.  The lyrics library was not working.  This section only test funcionality.
